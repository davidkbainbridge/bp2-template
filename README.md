# ![](bp_logo.png#top) BluePlanet2 - Go Micro-Service Example ![go-bp2](https://img.shields.io/badge/go--bp2-example-blue.svg)
This project represents an example BluePlanet2 (BP2) micro-service written in
Google's Go programming language and wrapped in an alpine based docker
container.

This example is meant to show both a standard project structure for a Go based
component as well as to demonstrate how dependencies / configuration is
injected into the micro-service and how the micro service advertises its
capabilities.
